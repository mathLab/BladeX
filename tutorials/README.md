# Tutorials

In this folder you can find a collection of useful tutorials in order to understand the principles and the potential of **BladeX**.

#### [Tutorial 1](https://github.com/mathLab/BladeX/blob/master/tutorials/tutorial-1-generate_foils.ipynb)
Here we show how to prepare a blade 2D sectional profile through generating legacy and custom foils.

#### [Tutorial 2](https://github.com/mathLab/BladeX/blob/master/tutorials/tutorial-2-transform_foils.ipynb)
Here we show how to proceed with preparing a blade 2D sectional profile by performing several transformation operations on the generated foils.

#### [Tutorial 3](https://github.com/mathLab/BladeX/blob/master/tutorials/tutorial-3-generate_blade.ipynb)
Here we show how to prepare a blade 3D sectional profiles by applying all the transformations due to the radial distribution of the blade parameters.

#### [Tutorial 4](https://github.com/mathLab/BladeX/blob/master/tutorials/tutorial-4-deform_blade.ipynb)
Here we show how to deform a blade and its parametric curves by using a parameter file.

#### More to come...
We plan to add more tutorials but the time is often against us. If you want to contribute with a notebook on a feature not covered yet we will be very happy and give you support on editing!
