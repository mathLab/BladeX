## Description
**BladeX** is a Python package for geometrical parametrization and bottom-up construction of propeller blades. It allows to generate and deform a blade based on the radial distribution of its parameters such as `pitch`, `rake`, `skew`, and the sectional foils' parameters such as `chord` and `camber`. The package is ideally suited for parametric simulations on large number of blade deformations. It provides an automated procedure for the CAD generation, hence reducing the time and effort required for modelling. The main scope of BladeX is to deal with propeller blades, however it can be flexible to be applied on further applications with analogous geometrical structures such as aircraft wings, turbomachinery, or wind turbine blades.

See the [**Examples**](#examples) section below and the [**Tutorials**](tutorials/README.md) to have an idea of the potential of this package.

## Dependencies and installation
**BladeX** requires `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`, `sphinx` (for the documentation), and `nose` (for the local test). They can be easily installed using `pip`. 
**BladeX** is compatible with Python 2.7 and Python 3.6. Moreover, some of the modules require `OCC` to be installed for the `.iges` or `.stl` CAD generation. Please see the table below for instructions on how to satisfy the `OCC` requirements. You can also refer to `pythonocc.org` or `github.com/tpaviot/pythonocc-core` for further instructions.

### Installing from source
The official distribution is on GitHub, and you can clone the repository using
```bash
> git clone https://github.com/mathLab/BladeX
```

To install the latest version of the package just type:
```bash
> pip install git+https://github.com/mathLab/BladeX.git
```

Otherwise to install your own local branch you can use the `setup.py` file
```bash
> python setup.py install
```

To uninstall the package just use pip again:

```bash
> pip uninstall bladex
```

## Documentation
**BladeX** uses [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/) for code documentation. You can view the documentation online [here](http://mathlab.github.io/BladeX/). To build the html version of the docs locally simply:

```bash
> cd docs
> make html
```

The generated html can be found in `docs/build/html`. Open up the `index.html` you find there to browse.


## Testing

We are using Travis CI for continuous intergration testing. You can check out the current status [here](https://travis-ci.org/mathLab/BladeX).

To run tests locally:

```bash
> python test.py
```

## Examples
You can find useful tutorials on how to use the package in the [tutorials](tutorials/README.md) folder.
Here we show a bottom-up parametrized construction of the [Potsdam Propeller Test Case (PPTC)](https://www.sva-potsdam.de/pptc-smp11-workshop) provided the sectional profiles as well as the radial distribution of the `pitch`, `rake`, `skew`. The blade is generated and exported to .iges and .stl formats.

## How to contribute
We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project. There are just a few small guidelines you need to follow.

### Submitting a patch

  1. It's generally best to start by opening a new issue describing the bug or
     feature you're intending to fix.  Even if you think it's relatively minor,
     it's helpful to know what people are working on.  Mention in the initial
     issue that you are planning to work on that bug or feature so that it can
     be assigned to you.

  2. Follow the normal process of [forking][] the project, and setup a new
     branch to work in.  It's important that each group of changes be done in
     separate branches in order to ensure that a pull request only includes the
     commits related to that bug or feature.

  3. To ensure properly formatted code, please make sure to use 4
     spaces to indent the code. The easy way is to run on your bash the provided
     script: ./code_formatter.sh. You should also run [pylint][] over your code.
     It's not strictly necessary that your code be completely "lint-free",
     but this will help you find common style issues.

  4. Any significant changes should almost always be accompanied by tests.  The
     project already has good test coverage, so look at some of the existing
     tests if you're unsure how to go about it. We're using [coveralls][] that
     is an invaluable tools for seeing which parts of your code aren't being
     exercised by your tests.

  5. Do your best to have [well-formed commit messages][] for each change.
     This provides consistency throughout the project, and ensures that commit
     messages are able to be formatted properly by various git tools.

  6. Finally, push the commits to your fork and submit a [pull request][]. Please,
     remember to rebase properly in order to maintain a clean, linear git history.
